# Examples of the Application usage.

* [An example of a lattice from a binary context.](https://github.com/AlekseyBuzmakov/FCAPS/blob/master/FCAPS/EXAMPLES/lattice-for-StandardFCA.md)
* [Computation of the Pattern Lattice for a composite Pattern Structure.](https://github.com/AlekseyBuzmakov/FCAPS/blob/master/FCAPS/EXAMPLES/Lattice-Computation-for-Composite-PS.md) Shows how to combine diferent pattern structures into one and how to deal with interval pattern structures.
* Computation of the Pattern Lattice for [a simple](https://github.com/AlekseyBuzmakov/FCAPS/blob/master/FCAPS/EXAMPLES/Lattice-Computation-for-simple-Sequential-Context.md) and [a general](https://github.com/AlekseyBuzmakov/FCAPS/blob/master/FCAPS/EXAMPLES/Lattice-Computation-for-general-Sequential-Context.md) Sequential Pattern Structures.
